</div>	

	
<div class="textParagraph">2. WHAT YOU WILL DO	</div>
<div class="textParagraph">If you agree to participate in this study, you will be asked to complete an online survey that asks questions about your attitude toward the Facebook exercise posts and their tie-strength with the one who generated the posts.
<br>
Eligibility Criteria
<br>
Participants must be at least 18 years of age or older.
</div>
<div class="textParagraph">3. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  <br>

</div>
<div class="textParagraph">4. POTENTIAL RISKS	<br>
There are no known risks for participating in this study. 
</div>
<div class="textParagraph">5.  PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY	<br>
The data for this project are being collected anonymously. Neither the researchers nor anyone else will be able to link any data to an individual subject. You will be assigned a random subject number, which will be the only way to identify you in any reports about the study. The investigators listed on the project will have access to research records. Additionally, any member of the Institutional Review Board may have access to research records. De-identified data will be stored in a secure computer file for a period of 5 years after the last publication from this project and at least three years after the close of study. Your privacy will be protected to the maximum extent allowable by law.
</div>
<div class="textParagraph">6. YOUR RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE, SAY NO, OR WITHDRAW  <br> 
Participation is completely voluntary. Refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. You may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. You have the right to say no. You may change your mind at any time and withdraw.
You may choose not to answer specific questions or to stop participating at any time.  Whether you choose to participate or not will have no effect on your grade or evaluation in any class at MSU.  
</div>

<div class="textParagraph">7.  COSTS AND COMPENSATION FOR BEING IN THE STUDY	<br>
There is no cost for you to participate. In exchange for participation, you will receive .25 SONA course credits (through http://msucas.sona-systems.com). In the SONA system, 1 hour of research participation is worth 1 SONA credit and this credit is pro-rated in 15-minute increments. It is up to individual course instructors to determine how many points this converts to in their classes (this should be specified in the syllabus for each course).  

The duration of this online survey is approximately 15 minutes. Hence, participants who complete this survey will receive .25 SONA credits.
 
Participation in this study is voluntary. You may withdraw at any time without penalty. This means that no SONA credits will be deducted from your account, nor will withdrawal have any effect on your relationship with any of your instructors. Participants who withdraw partway through the study will be awarded credit based on the portion of the study they complete (1/2 completion = .125 SONA credit). Students who view the materials but do not participate in any part of the research will receive 0 SONA credit.
 
If you are not able to participate, or wish to earn extra credits, but not participate in this experiment, there are alternate options within the Comm. Arts & Sciences SONA system or through your instructor. If you withdraw, no SONA credits will be deducted from you.
